## Introduction

Keeping track of login credentials for multiple apps can be a
daunting task. With the
increasing number of apps we use daily, it’s not uncommon to have
dozens or even
hundreds of accounts to manage.
Storing this information in a book or on a piece of paper can be
risky and inconvenient.
Retrieving the required information can be{" "}
time consuming and frustrating,
especially if you have to search through multiple pages or
documents. Therefore, it’s important to have a secure and efficient
system in place to manage and retrieve login credentials easily.
